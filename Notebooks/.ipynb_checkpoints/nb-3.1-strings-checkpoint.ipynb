    "### Details on strings versus bytes\n",
    "Although strings seem like a simple data type, being just characters of text, when you dive in deeper you find they are actually quite complex. This is particularly true in Python3 which, as opposed to Python2, has two distinct types called `strings` and `bytes`, which I have been referring to so far simply as strings. Technically, bytes are the representations of text that can be written to your hard disk, whereas strings are simply a mapping of those bytes to a certain type of decoding. In this way, the same set of bytes can represent difference strings depending on the encoding type. This is particularly useful for representing the full range of characters and emojis and other things exist in text today. Simply, a string is for showing to humans while a bytestring is for storing on disk. Let's see some examples. "
